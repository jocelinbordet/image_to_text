# image_to_text

This project was developed by @mbatoul and I for a deep learning project within the X-HEC Data Science program. 

Our goal was to build an app that generates a short natural language description from an image (either uploaded on jpg or from a webcam).

Main source : https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning.

I am currently working on a second version.
